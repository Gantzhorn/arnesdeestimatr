`arnesdeestimr` is an R package for statistical inference and parameter estimation in stochastic differential equations (SDEs).  
It aims to provide easy-to-use tools for simulation, estimation, and diagnostics of SDE models.


## Status

> This package is currently being developed during my research semester at  
> **_Universit√© Grenoble Alpes_** supported by the **_Rejselegat for Matematikere_** travel grant.

---

## Technical Details

To optimize performance-critical computations, `arnesdeestimr` leverages **Rcpp** for seamless integration of C++ code with R.  
This ensures fast and efficient estimation procedures suitable for large or complex SDE models.
